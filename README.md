# hbkr-tasks

This a personal project to gain an understanding of vue.js and also extend my PHP skills by making use of the Laravel framework. The end goal of this project is to produce an advanced to-do list type system that can potentially assist project management scenarios. Expect it to be responsive taking a mobile-first approach to styling, include a handful of animations as well as inclusion of some personally produced bespoke graphics.

## Current Features
* Reactive routing for pages
* Mark tasks as active or completed
* Add new tasks to a list
* Edit existing tasks and log time of last edit
* Delete single tasks with confirmation
* Clear all completed tasks easily with a single confirmation
* Filter a list of tasks by all, active or completed (also sorting by user sorted preference)
* Track total tasks and quantity of remaining incomplete tasks
* Basic animations
* Display reactive random inspirational quote when task list is empty
* Pin important task to top of the list

## Features in Progress
* Laravel REST API implementation for storing and retrieving data
* Data validation, require data where essential

## Features to Implement
* Mobile support for editing
* Improved styling with mobile-first style approach
* Multiple lists per user
* Simple user account
* Basic user authentication
* (Maybe) Drag and drop list ordering
* Allow the user to define a custom order for their tasks to be displayed
* Remember user-preferred order for next visit
