# hbkr-tasks

This a personal project to gain an understanding of vue.js and also extend my PHP skills by making use of the Laravel framework. The end goal of this project is to be an advanced to-do list type system. It will also likely be forked for extended functionality for a potentially commercial project. Expect it to be responsive taking a mobile-first approach to styles and the inclusion of some reasonable bespoke graphics.
