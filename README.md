# hbkr-tasks

This a personal project to gain an understanding of vue.js and also extend my PHP skills by making use of the Laravel framework. The end goal of this project is to produce a fairly feature-packed task management system that can potentially assist project management scenarios with a focus on software development. The aim is for the interface to be produced through a mobile-first approach to styling, include a handful of animations. As features are completed, final touches will be added through the inclusion of some personally produced bespoke graphics.

## Current Features
* Reactive routing for pages
* Mark tasks as active or completed
* Add new tasks to a list
* Edit existing tasks and log time of last edit
* Delete single tasks with confirmation
* Clear all completed tasks easily with a single confirmation
* Filter a list of tasks by all, active or completed (also sorting by user sorted preference)
* Track total tasks and quantity of remaining incomplete tasks
* Basic animations
* Display reactive random inspirational quote when task list is empty
* Pin important task to top of the list
* (Basic level) Remembering user-preferred order for next visit

## Features in Progress
* Laravel REST API implementation for storing and retrieving data
* Data validation, require data where essential
* Drag and drop list ordering

## Features to Implement
* Mobile support for editing
* Improved styling with mobile-first style approach
* Multiple lists per user
* Simple user account
* Basic user authentication
* Allow the user to define a custom order for their tasks to be displayed
* More advanced user-customisation of list order, remembering for next user visit
